# Distributed-Distance-Vector-Routing

This project implements distributed distance vector routing (DVR) algorithm. I am provided with a sample network (nodes, their connectivity and link weights), and this program finds the shortest paths from each node to all other nodes using DVR algorithm


Instructions:
  - Move inside project directory containing my-dvr.py source file.
  = Run command "python3 my-dvr.py" on cmd or terminal
  - Observe ring topology response answer fields in OUPUT.txt located in project directory
